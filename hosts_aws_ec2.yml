# Dynamic Amazon Web Services inventory
#
# The basic stratgy of this inventory file is to use the AWS tag 'Environment'
# to determine the group the EC2 host belongs to.
#
# Note: this file MUST end with 'aws_ec2.yml' in order for Ansible to detect it
# properly. See: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory.html
#
plugin: aws_ec2
boto_profile: default

# Prefer the public address as the hostname
hostnames:
  - ip-address

# Add groups for each Environment tag value (staging, production, etc)
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.Environment
    prefix: ""
    separator: ""
    
# Inject host variables based on EC2 instance tags and attributes

  ec2_env: tags.Environment
  ec2_region: placement_region
